This is the source code for my personal website hosted on Vercel at https://hmzelidrissi.ma. The project is developed with Astro.

## Description

My personal website is a platform where I share my projects, thoughts, ideas, experiences, and insights on various topics that interest me. It serves as a space for me to express myself, connect with others, and contribute to meaningful discussions within the community.

## Deployment

The blog is automatically deployed to Vercel whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub. This ensures that the latest version of the blog is always live and accessible to visitors.

This blog is a digital home. It's been revived a few times over the past 10+ years, and each time it's taken a different form.

A brain dump, in a way. Some things might be useful for you, some not as much. But regardless, keep in mind that the primary audience is in fact just me.

So far in life my driver has been curiosity; I get the same rush from learning that trees often live in a family, feed their neighbors, and can signal imminent danger to others through smell, that I get from learning about the inner-workings of a technology system, or navigating complex people and organizational dynamics.

To satisfy my curiosity, I build things. Beside being a cathartic experience by itself, building is my learning highway, in addition to teaching and mentoring.

I’m lucky enough to have made a career out of being curious; as a consultant early on, then as a startup studio founder and investor, a university lecturer, an engineer, and as a business guy.

I took a break from the corp world in 2021 to focus on slightly more important items from my life’s to do list – while time is still running, and this blog captures some of that journey.

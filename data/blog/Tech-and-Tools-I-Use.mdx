![Tools](/static/images/blog/13/01.jpg)

A list of tools I use whether for:

- Personal side projects
- My full-time job
- Or working with clients

## Code

The code editor I'm currently using is VSCode, but sometimes while using Ubuntu, I use Sublime Text.

### stacks

- Primary stack:

  - FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic
  - Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis (when required)
  - Uvicorn, httpx
    - Tools like: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, pytest-mock, etc...

- Secondary stack:

  - Django.
  - Serverless functions are written in Python (when required).
  - API integration with Python (when required).
  - Test integrations (ex. pytest, unittest, etc).
  - Markdown, Yaml, JSON, etc... (when required)
  - Tools like Celery, Redis, Postgres, etc...

This stack mostly I use it while building my opensource projects or with some clients, I work with.

I use Git bash as my terminal when I’m on windows, iTerm2 with "oh my zsh" themes when I’m on macOS.

### Optional tools

- Some Projects I work on require some tools and external libraries or APIs like:

- Firebase auth
- Auth0
- Prisma-Client
- Stripe
- Google Cloud Platform
- etc...

- AWS in a manual way too.

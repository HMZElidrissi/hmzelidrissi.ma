![OOP](/static/images/blog/02/02.jpg)

Just like many of us, I began my coding journey with procedural programming. It's like learning the basics of handling a bicycle before even thinking about a motorcycle. It's straightforward and logical, making it an excellent starting point for anyone new to programming. However, as you progress and your projects become more complex, you'll inevitably encounter the need for a more sophisticated toolset – that's where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes into play.

## What is OOP?

It is a paradigm that consists of modeling a problem with a set of objects:

> **OOP** ≡ (**SET OF OBJECTS AND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE OBJECTS**)

- An object represents a concept, an idea, or any entity from the physical world (a car, a person, or even a page of a book).
- OOP is easily conceivable because it describes entities as they exist in the real world.
- The program is built around objects that combine data (**_attributes_**) and actions (**_methods_**).

> **Advantages of OOP:** ease of organization, reusability, inheritance capability, ease of correction, easier to manage projects.

- OOP allows securing a program by either allowing or prohibiting access to these objects by other parts of the program.

## What is an Object?

It is a data structure responsible for managing data, organizing it, and storing it in a certain form:

> **OBJECT** ≡ **IDENTITY** + **STATE** (attributes) + **BEHAVIOR** (member methods)

- **Identity**: An object has an identity that allows it to be distinguished from other objects, regardless of its state.
- **Attributes**: These are the data characterizing the object. They are variables that store information about the object's state.
- **Methods** (member functions): An object's methods characterize its behavior, i.e., the set of actions that allow:
  - To **consult**, **modify**, etc.… the object's state (the values of the attributes),
  - To **communicate** with other objects by sending messages to perform a process...
- Communications between objects are synchronous: The calling object waits for a response before being able to do something else.

## What is a Class?

Objects of the same nature belong to the same family called Class:

**CLASS** ≡ (**Abstraction of a set of objects sharing a common structure and common behavior**)

**CLASS** ≡ **INSTANTIATION** + **ATTRIBUTES** (instance variables) + **MEMBER METHODS**

- **Instantiation**: represents the relationship between an object and its belonging class that allowed its creation.
- **Attributes** (also called instance variables): They have a name and a type: either a **basic type** (simple or constructed), or a **class** (the attribute references an object of the same or another class).
- **Member methods**: They are the operations applicable to an object of the class. They can modify all or part of an object's state and return calculated values based on that state.

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** (class derivation): the mechanism that allows creating a class **_(derived class, subclass, or child class)_** from an existing class **(superclass or parent class)**.

> **Inheritance** ≡ (**Generalization**/**Specialization** relationship between classes)

- The subclass is a specialized version of its superclass.
- The subclass inherits the variables and methods of its superclass.
- The subclass can have other variables and methods that are specific to it (**_specialization_**).
- A superclass can have multiple subclasses.
- Methods and properties can be inherited at level n, meaning an object can use a method from its mother's mother and so on.
- The major advantage of inheritance is not having to start from scratch when specializing an existing class.
- **Types of Inheritance:**
  - **Single Inheritance:** a class can inherit only one superclass.
  - **Multiple Inheritance:** some object-oriented languages, such as C++, allow for multiple inheritance, which means they offer the possibility of inheriting a class from two or more superclasses. This technique allows grouping attributes and methods of multiple classes into a single class.

> **_Example:_**
>
> - **Superclass**: Think of it as a family tree's root, with common traits passed to all descendants.
> - **Subclass**: These are like individual family branches that inherit common traits but may also have their unique characteristics.
> - **Inheritance Level**: Similar to how people inherit traits from ancestors at different generations.

## Polymorphism:

It is the object's ability to belong to multiple classes:

> **POLYMORPHISM** ≡ (**OBJECT'S ABILITY TO HAVE MULTIPLE FORMS**)

- Do not confuse polymorphism with multiple inheritance: polymorphism is the object's ability to modify its own behavior and that of its descendants during execution, while multiple inheritance allows an object to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes at once.
- A function, method, or object is polymorphic if it can be used with multiple types (functions or methods with only one type are called **monomorphic**).
- Polymorphism can be classified into 3 types:
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (**overloading**),
  - Parametric polymorphism (**generics**),
  - Inheritance polymorphism (**overriding**).

> **_Example:_** Think of a universal remote control that can adjust the volume on different brands of TVs. The remote's buttons remain the same, but they work with various TV models.

## Encapsulation:

It is a mechanism (also called abstraction) that involves grouping data and methods within a structure while hiding the object's implementation.

> **ENCAPSULATION** ≡ **DATA PROTECTION** (public or private)

- Encapsulation allows defining visibility levels for class elements to provide access rights to data via a method of the class itself, a subclass, or any class.
- There are 3 visibility levels:
  - **Public**: functions from all classes can access the data or methods of a class defined with public visibility.
  - **Protected**: only member functions of the subclass and its descendants can access the data.
  - **Private**: only methods of the class itself can access the data.

> **_Example:_**
>
> - **Car Dashboard**: The dashboard exposes controls like the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons for lights and wipers. It hides the intricate engine and transmission systems.
> - **Visibility Levels**: These are like different levels of access to the dashboard controls: public (anyone can use them), protected (only authorized users), and private (only the driver).

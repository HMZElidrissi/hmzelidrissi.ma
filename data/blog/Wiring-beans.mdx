summary: 'Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the input source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens for the parser to process.'

# WHAT IS A COMPILER?

> “**_A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into another language, usually machine code._**”

## EXAMPLES OF COMPILERS

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** GCC is a powerful compiler that compiles code written in C, C++, and other languages to machine code.
- **Babel:** Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Java Compiler:** The Java compiler converts Java code into Java bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# WHY LEARN ABOUT COMPILERS?

- **Understanding Programming Languages:** Compilers help you understand how programming languages are designed and implemented.
- **A real use-case of your fancy data structures and algorithms:** Compilers are complex software systems that require knowledge of data structures and algorithms to optimize code generation.

# HOW DO COMPILERS WORK?

1. **Lexical Analysis:** The compiler breaks the source code into tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators).
2. **Syntax Analysis:** The compiler checks the syntax of the code to ensure it follows the rules of the programming language.
3. **Semantic Analysis:** The compiler checks the meaning of the code to ensure it is semantically correct.
4. **Intermediate Code Generation:** The compiler generates an intermediate representation of the code.
5. **Code Optimization:** The compiler optimizes the intermediate code to improve performance.
6. **Code Generation:** The compiler generates machine code or bytecode from the optimized intermediate code.

# HOW TO BUILD A COMPILER?

- **LEXER** : The lexer reads the input source code character by character and groups them into tokens.
- **PARSER** : The parser reads the tokens generated by the lexer and checks if they form valid statements according to the grammar of the programming language.
- **ANALYZER/TRANSFORMER** : The analyzer checks the semantics of the code and transforms it into an intermediate representation.
- **OPTIMIZER** : The optimizer improves the intermediate representation to make the code more efficient.
- **EMITTER** : The emitter generates the final machine code or bytecode from the optimized intermediate representation.

## COMPILER DESIGN

1. **Choose a Programming Language:** Decide on the programming language you want to compile.
2. **Design the Compiler:** Design the structure of the compiler, including the lexer, parser, and code generator.
3. **Implement the Compiler:** Write the code for the lexer, parser, and code generator.
4. **Test the Compiler:** Test the compiler with sample programs to ensure it works correctly.
5. **Optimize the Compiler:** Optimize the compiler to improve performance and efficiency.

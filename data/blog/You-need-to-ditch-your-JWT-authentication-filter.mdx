# You need to ditch your JWT authentication filter: Spring Boot authentication using JWT

I think it's time to ditch your JWT authentication filter. I know, I know, it's been working fine for you so far. But hear me out. Last month I had a conversation with my friend [Abdeljabar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdeljabar-aitayoub) about securing REST APIs in spring boot with JWT, and we noticed that the tutorials have a different approach than the philosophy of the framework. It uses a custom JWTAuthenticationFilter and JWTService while the docs talk about OAuth2 Resource Server, we had a long debate, it was confusing, and we decided to investigate further, I emailed **Daniel Garnier-Moiroux** one of the active contributors to Spring Security, and he confirmed that all those tutorials are rather outdated and should be updated! The correct way would using resource-server, with any of the configuration options available (https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html#_specifying_the_authorization_server).

# Show me the code

Let's see how we can implement a simple resource server with Spring Security.

## Set up dependencies

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Configure Cookies

Create a CookieUtil class to manage JWT cookies:

```java
@Component
public class CookieUtil {
    // Configure cookie properties
    private String cookieName = "jwt-token";
    private int cookieExpiry = 86400;  // 24 hours

    // Method to create a secure cookie
    public void createCookie(HttpServletResponse response, String token) {
        ResponseCookie cookie = ResponseCookie.from(cookieName, token)
            .httpOnly(true)   // Prevents JavaScript access
            .secure(true)     // HTTPS only
            .path("/")
            .maxAge(cookieExpiry)
            .build();
        response.addHeader(HttpHeaders.SET_COOKIE, cookie.toString());
    }
}
```

## Configure Security

### BearTokenResolver

```java
@Bean
public BearerTokenResolver cookieBearerTokenResolver() {
    return cookieUtil::extractToken;
}
```

- Customizes how spring security extracts the token from the request.
- Instead of looking for the token in the Authorization header, we will extract it from the cookie.
- Using Cookies for JWT is more secure than storing it in the local storage, because cookies are not accessible by JavaScript.

### JwtDecoder

```java
@Bean
public JwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
    return NimbusJwtDecoder.withPublicKey(publicKey).build();
}
```

- Decodes and verifies the JWT token.
- The public key is used to verify the signature of the token.

### JwtEncoder

```java
@Bean
public JwtEncoder jwtEncoder() {
    JWK jwk = new RSAKey.Builder(publicKey)
        .privateKey(privateKey)
        .build();
    JWKSource<SecurityContext> jwks = new ImmutableJWKSet<>(new JWKSet(jwk));
    return new NimbusJwtEncoder(jwks);
}
```

- Creates new JWT tokens during authentication.
- Uses the private key to sign the token.
- Sets up the RSA key pair for token signing.
- Creates a JWK (JSON Web Key) source for the encoder.

### JwtAuthenticationConverter

```java
@Bean
public JwtAuthenticationConverter jwtAuthenticationConverter() {
    JwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter authoritiesConverter =
        new JwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter();
    authoritiesConverter.setAuthoritiesClaimName("role");
    authoritiesConverter.setAuthorityPrefix("ROLE_");

    JwtAuthenticationConverter converter = new JwtAuthenticationConverter();
    converter.setJwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter(authoritiesConverter);
    return converter;
}
```

- Converts JWT claims into Spring Security authorities.
- Configures how roles are extracted from the token.

### Security Configuration

```java
public class SecurityConfig {
    private final CookieUtil cookieUtil;
    @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.private-key}")
    private RSAPrivateKey privateKey;

    @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.public-key}")
    private RSAPublicKey publicKey;

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(STATELESS))
                .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> {
                    oauth2.bearerTokenResolver(cookieBearerTokenResolver());
                    oauth2.jwt(jwt -> jwt
                            .decoder(jwtDecoder())
                            .jwtAuthenticationConverter(jwtAuthenticationConverter())
                    );
                });

        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
}
```

- Disables session management.
- Configures the resource server with the custom token resolver, decoder, and authentication converter.

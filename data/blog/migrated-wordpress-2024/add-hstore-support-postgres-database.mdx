Postgres doesn't have HStore enabled by default (especially if you're using [Postgresapp](http://postgresapp.com) on OSX ); There is a quick fix though.

```sh
# This is to enable hstore in your current database
$ psql YOUR_CURRENT_DATABASE -c 'create extension hstore;'

# And this is to enable it for your future databases
$ psql template1 -c 'create extension hstore;'
```

Simple !

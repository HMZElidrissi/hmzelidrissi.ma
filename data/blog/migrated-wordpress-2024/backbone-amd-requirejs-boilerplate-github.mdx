Everyone knows how big of a headache it is to write heavy JS applications - even in BackboneJS. The codebase tends to span across thousands of lines, with no modularityÂ whatsoever.

Backbone-AMD is the solution. But bootstrapping a Backbone-AMD compliant app is no easy task ... until now : )

I just released an [open source Backbone-AMD Boilerplate](https://github.com/zakelfassi/backbone-amd-boilerplate) - feel free to fork, pull, suggest, ... and share !

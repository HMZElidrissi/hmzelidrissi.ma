A release candidate of [Bootstrap 3 was previewed](http://rc.getbootstrap.com) earlier today. The last major release dates back to Jan 28th 2012 ... more than a year ago.

Personally, one thing struck me : the flat design. But in a very positive way, mainly because of two things :

1. I love super-minimalistic UIs.
2. I can't stand prototyping my apps with a *Twitteresque* design (I have a Bootstrap flat fork for that).

The bad news (at least for me) is the [flat design is only temporary](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342#issuecomment-12332378).

The other bad news, except the *default responsiveness* (responsive styles are now included in the main stylesheets - [navbar example](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/3.0.0-wip/less/navbar.less)), I can't see any major change in Bootstrap 3. At least for the time being !

# Get it now.

If you want to get while hot, and can't stand the teaser download link, here's a [direct link via the Bootstrap 3 GitHub working branch](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/archive/3.0.0-wip.zip).

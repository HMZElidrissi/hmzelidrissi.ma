summary: "Exploring the intriguing question of machine understanding, this post recounts a personal experience with a Mac's White Screen of Death during crucial workshops in Tunisia. It ponders whether machines can communicate on a higher level with humans, beyond random behavior or technical functionality."

I was in Tunisia to give two workshops (UX design and Mobile HTML5) for the [TNWebDays](http://tnwebdays.com 'TNwebDays') - live coding sessions, use cases and whatnot.

Basically, my laptop (Macbook Pro) was crucial for this mission.

But, like any machine that has got some self esteem, it crashed as I was about to wrap up the presentations. That crash is vastly known in the Apple community as "_White screen of death_". And quickly recoverable by resetting the PRAM by pressing **Command+Option+P+R**.

Anyhow - as always, I kept calm. And asked a tunisian friend to borrow his machine for the next day to improvise a presentation.

But it didn't make sense. Why would a machine crash for no apparent reason ? But mostly, why wasn't the keyboard responding when resetting the PRAM ? Basically, the thing was fried.

I went for a walk, came back, prayed the problem would fix itself. Nothing.

I slept. The next day, powered up the machine, still nothing.

Went to get breakfast, and came back to my room. Opened the lid, and asked gently (mostly, with emotion):

> Dear Mac, you helped me when I most needed it. You were there to inspire me when I lacked it. Please don't fuck me up, and power up. Even for two hours until I finish my talks.

Then pressed the power button.

And what do you know ... It worked.

I freaked out for a bit - but, then I realised, that sometimes machine behaviour can be random. Or is it ?

Do machines really understand us ? or is it our emotion ? or is it just plain random ?!!

The real question, essentially, could we build machines can can communicate with us on a higher level ? I'm not talking about terminator-like stuff; just machines that share a common ground with humans ...

*Side note* : Funny thing is, I was introducing UX by talking about how the Windows "Blue Screen of Death" doesn't offer a user experience, sometimes, even for experimented users. In retrospective, the BSoD at least does offer some hexadecimal gibberish (and mostly, heart beat signal) thing that the WSoD **does not**.

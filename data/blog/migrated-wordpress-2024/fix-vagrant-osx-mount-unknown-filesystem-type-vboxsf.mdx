If you just started using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com 'Vagrant') (_which I highly recommend_), and on the last version of OSX (_or any other system as a matter of fact_) + VirtualBox, it's highly likely that you'll stumble on an error during your first \`vagrant up\` :

```sh
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` /vagrant /vagrant
Stdout from the command:

Stderr from the command:
mount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'
```

The sharing isn't setup. A bit frustrating. And you'll need to install Guest Additions on the box (and that's not straightforward if using Vagrant).

Turns out, the fix is quite easy.

First, download : [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.16/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.2.16.iso](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.16/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.2.16.iso 'VBoxGuestAdditions_4.2.16') (replace **4.2.16** by your VirtualBox version).

Now fire up VirtualBox, select your virtual machine, **Command+F** to power it off, then **Command+S** for settings, select **Storage** then click on **_Add CD/DVD Device,_** then select the freshly downloaded ISO.

Go back to your app directory (where you executed the **vagrant init** command), and launch vagrant :

```sh
vagrant up && vagrant ssh

# First, install required dependencies.
sudo yum install gcc -y
sudo yum install kernel sources -y
sudo yum install kernel-devel -y
exit # exit from vagrant

# Reload the machine and fire Vagrant
vagrant halt && vagrant up && vagrant ssh

# Mount the disk
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom # Use /dev/cdrom2 if it's a second disk.
cd /media/cdrom
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run # Follow the instructions

exit
vagrant reload
vagrant ssh
```

Now you should be up and running !

As the time of writing this post, [Viber](http://www.viber.com/products/mac) didn't release an updated version that supports Mac OS X Yosemite.

Chances are the app icon is marked with an **X** and you get an error message once you try to launch it.

It's pretty easy to actually fix this issue; Just head to your **Applications** directory, right-click on the Viber icon then **Show package contents**. Navigate to the **Contents** folder and open **Info.plist** ; Note that you'd probably need a Plist file editor installed (or XCode) to edit this file. If it's not the case, just open it with your preferred text editor - and you'll get something like this:

Notice the highlighted lines - all you need to do is change the values **4** and **4.0.0** to, respectively, **5** and **5.0.0**

Save your file. Relaunch Viber. You're good to go!

Since its launch a few weeks ago, [LiberTweet](http://libertweet.com 'LiberTweet') (_the only app that integrates seamlessly with the Twitter web and Android clients to make longer tweets - and also, my new born baby_) had gone through some major changes.

But the biggest update by far, is this one : now even if your followers don't have the Android app/Chrome extension installed, they can still see your long tweets inside their twitter clients (Web, Android, iOS, Tweetdeck ...) ! See the images below :

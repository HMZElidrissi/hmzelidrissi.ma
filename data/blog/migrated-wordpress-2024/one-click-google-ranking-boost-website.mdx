Since the launch of Google+, Google -the search engine- started emphasising *social* into its ranking; mostly, the top results you see are in this order (though, I'm just scratching the surface) :

1. Relevant results which have been **shared** by people in your circles.
2. **Relevant** non-social results.
3. Less relevant results, but with some kind of **social presence**.

You can have control over the 1st (sharing in Google+ and getting +1s) or 2nd case (basic SEO stuff), but it would take some kind of _work_, strategic or technical work.

It turns out, the 3rd kind is the easiest one to get -just a few clicks away; You just have to sync the post's author with its Google+ profile. Technically, this is achieved by :

1. Adding **a <link rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/YOUR\_PROFILE\_ID" />** tag in the page's header.
2. Edit the **Contributor to** section of your Google+ profile : _https://plus.google.com/YOUR\_PROFILE\_ID/about/edit/co_
3. Test everything using [Google's rich snippet tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)

Easy peasy.

If you're running a Wordpress blog, there's a neat plugin that achieves the first step quickly, even while having multiple authors on the blog : [Google Plus Authorship](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-plus-authorship/ 'Google Plus Authorship '). Just install and add the Google+ profile link on the author's page.

summary: "Analyzing the success of Wordle, this post discusses how its simplicity and design, which limits user actions, creates a unique and engaging experience. Comparing it to Flappy Bird, it highlights the power of inaction in game design, inspired by Jinny Uppal's book In/Action: Rethinking the Path to Results, suggesting a new perspective on achieving results through minimalism."

After much resistance to the temptation of the phenomenon, I bit the bullet.

Wordle 221 4/6

Last time something like the Wordle phenomenon happened was with Flappy Bird. There are multiple striking similarities between the two games. Both are relatively _simple_ products, where simplicity spills into becoming a fun challenge for users â€“ which is opposite Silicon Valley mode.

Instead of pushing the user to take an action (_by growth hacking and gamifying the shit out of a product_), how about making it impossible by design to do it (e.g., easy sharing, leaderboards, notifications, â€¦)?

The outcome is the impossible task becoming a fun challenge for the user -and overall user community, to collectively figure out how to do what they want to do. In this case, share the score and Wordle map with friends; for Flappy Bird, sharing the "Game Over" screenshot.

Simplicity can't be engineered nor predicted, however, there is genius in presenting the user with an "inaction state": an end state where the user is asked to do absolutely nothing else after they've done what they came to do.

This reminds me of a really great book I'm currently reading, by my friend **Jinny Uppal â€“ In/Action: Rethinking the Path to Results.** The book tackles the _inaction_ theme as being a different path to achieve similar (or in this case, much, much better?) results than our natural action-biased mindset.

And just like Wordle, you can find your own link.

I wonder what would happen along the way,

you were the "smart kid",

top of the class, prizes on the shelf, every teacher promising you that you’ll have a bright future. On paper, you have what it takes, you are talented, your brain is your superpower

but there’s a gap between what’s on paper and what’s in the world.

you’re watching people who struggled in the classroom launch projects and find success while you feel stuck. It feels unfair. It feels like you aren't getting what you "deserve."

recently I’ve been thinking about this a lot, I wanted to know the “**why”,** what is the hidden psychology behind this, because I don’t believe it’s luck, or that is an unspoken rule ..

### The algorithm

my analysis is that in school, you were programmed and the algorithm was simple:

**Prepare for the exam ⇒ Ace the test ⇒ Receive validation from teachers**

It was a linear path with a guaranteed reward, kind of a correlation, but this reward doesn’t stop here, it build your entire identity on being smart and on this algorithm and make you projecting this logic onto the rest of your life into a new equation:

**Make the PERFECT plan ⇒ Execute ⇒ Success ⇒ Receive validation from society**

but the problem is life doesn’t work this way, it much more complex and full with nuances 

### **Perfection**

when you were applying this "straight-A" logic, and your being smart bias to the real world, you hit a wall because the real world is messy, your first attempt often fails, and after failing you doubt yourself, you feel it is unfair, so you stay in your comfort zone because school taught you that failing isn't an option and things felt for you that it would come easy. It taught you to fear the bad grade on the paper and to avoid failure. So While you were busy making a "perfect" plan to increase your success rate, and applying school tricks to real life, your peers (the ones who weren't afraid to get a zero on exams) were out there making moves.

while you’re still standing at the starting line perfecting your form, your peers have already taken 20 steps, they probably failed 16 times but they succeeded 4 times and **now they are 4 steps ahead of you.**

**WHY?**

because while you are waiting for 100% certainty, they are playing a volume game, 

your perfectionism isn't a high standard; it’s an added weight, you didn’t learn how to fail and get back up, but they did, they learned that the "test" never actually ends.
they learn to fail and fail again, because guess what eventually they’ll learn and succeed,
